# Code Book for Human Activity Recognition Tidy Dataset

This code book describes the variables in the "FinalData.txt" file generated by the `run_analysis.R` script.

## Dataset Description

The dataset contains the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. The original data was collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone.

## Variables

* **subject:** The ID of the subject (integer, ranging from 1 to 30).
* **activity:** The type of activity performed when the corresponding measurements were taken   
 (factor with 6 levels): 
    * WALKING
    * WALKING_UPSTAIRS
    * WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
    * SITTING
    * STANDING
    * LAYING
* **The remaining variables are the averages of the mean and standard deviation measurements for each feature. These variables are named with the following pattern:**

    `[Domain][Signal][Instrument][Calculation][Axis]` (if applicable)

    where:

    * **Domain:** Time or Frequency
    * **Signal:**  Body, Gravity
    * **Instrument:** Accelerometer, Gyroscope
    * **Calculation:** Mean, STD
    * **Axis:** X, Y, Z

**Example:**

* `TimeBodyAccelerometerMeanX`: The average of the mean of the body acceleration signal obtained from the accelerometer for the X-axis in the time domain.

## Transformations

The following transformations were applied to the original data:

* **Merging:** The training and test datasets were merged.
* **Extraction:** Only measurements on the mean and standard deviation were extracted.
* **Descriptive Activity Names:** Activity codes were replaced with descriptive names.
* **Descriptive Variable Names:** Variable names were cleaned and made more informative.
* **Averaging:** The data was grouped by subject and activity, and the average of each variable was calculated for each group.
