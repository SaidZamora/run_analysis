# Human Activity Recognition Analysis

This repository contains R code and documentation for analyzing the "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones" dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to process and clean the raw data from the accelerometers of Samsung Galaxy S smartphones to create a tidy dataset that can be used for further analysis and modeling. The script performs the following steps:

1. **Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.**
2. **Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.**
3. **Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.**
4. **Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.**
5. **From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.**   


## Files

* **run_analysis.R:** The   
 R script that performs the data processing and cleaning.
* **README.md:** This file, providing a description of the project and the code.
* **CodeBook.md:** A code book describing the variables in the tidy dataset.
* **FinalData.txt:** The output tidy dataset generated by the script.

## How to Run the Script

1. Make sure you have the "UCI HAR Dataset" folder in your working directory or a location you can easily access.
2. Save the `run_analysis.R` script in your working directory.
3. Open R and set your working directory to the location where you saved the script.
4. Execute the script in R by typing `source("run_analysis.R")`.
5. When prompted, use the file selection window to choose the "UCI HAR Dataset" folder.

The script will generate the "FinalData.txt" file in your working directory.
